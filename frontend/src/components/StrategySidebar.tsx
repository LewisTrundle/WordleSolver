        <strong>About Starting Words:</strong> <br />
        The best starting word in Wordle depends on the solving strategy you use. For example, words like <span className="font-mono">SLATE</span>, <span className="font-mono">CRANE</span>, and <span className="font-mono">RAISE</span> are often optimal for entropy-based strategies, as they maximize information gain. Frequency-based strategies favor words with the most common letters, such as <span className="font-mono">ARISE</span> or <span className="font-mono">TEARS</span>. Minimax and partition strategies may suggest different words that minimize the worst-case or average-case remaining possibilities. There is no single best starting word for all strategiesâ€”each method may have its own optimal choice.
